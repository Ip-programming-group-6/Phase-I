# E-fund

## Background 
Fundraising or fund-raising is the process of seeking and gathering voluntary financial contributions by engaging individuals, businesses, 
charitable foundations, or governmental agencies. Although fundraising typically refers to efforts to gather money for non-profit organizations,
it is sometimes used to refer to the identification and solicitation of investors or other sources of capital for for-profit enterprises.

## Motivations

First and foremost, when we contribute to a cause we are making the world a better place. Whether we are donating our time, money or expertise,
there are recipient(s) benefiting from it. People may go to school because of the scholarship we or others fund through our platform and other options,
children may feel supported by the shelter or food they receive, animals may be saved because of the organization we promote and others donate too,
and societyâ€™s carbon footprint may decrease as a result of our research and efforts. Ultimately, giving back shows kindness and those around us see that.
